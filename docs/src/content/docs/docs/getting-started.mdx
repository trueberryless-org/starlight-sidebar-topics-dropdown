description: Learn how to split your documentation into different sections, called topics, each with its own sidebar.
---

This package allow you to set up a Starlight website with multiple topics, each with its own sidebar configuration. You can switch between these topics using a **dropdown** in the sidebar. This means that inactive topics are hidden from view. If you prefer seing all topics at once, you can just use the [Starlight Sidebar Topics](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/) plugin instead.

:::note
This package is based on [HiDeoo's Starlight Sidebar Topics](https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-sidebar-topics) plugin. Please make sure you install the [Starlight Sidebar Topics](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/) plugin and follow [the getting started guide](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/getting-started) before using this package.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

Moreover, you will need to have the [Starlight Sidebar Topics](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/) plugin installed and configured correctly.
If you don't have it yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/getting-started) guide in the Starlight Sidebar Topics docs to set it up.

## Installation

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { PackageManagers } from "@hideoo/starlight-plugins-docs-components";

<Steps>

1. Starlight Sidebar Topics Dropdown is a Starlight component which is based on the [Starlight Sidebar Topics](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/) plugin. Install it using your favorite package manager:

    <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-sidebar-topics-dropdown" />

2. Configure the component override in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#components) in the `astro.config.mjs` file by overriding the `Sidebar` component with the `TopicsDropdownSidebarOverride` component:

    ```diff lang="js"
    // astro.config.mjs
    // @ts-check
    import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
    import starlightSidebarTopics from 'starlight-sidebar-topics'

    export default defineConfig({
      integrations: [
        starlight({
    +      components: {
    +        Sidebar: "starlight-sidebar-topics-dropdown/TopicsDropdownSidebarOverride.astro",
    +      },
          plugins: [
            starlightSidebarTopics([
             {
                label: 'Guides',
                link: '/guides/',
                icon: 'open-book',
                items: ['guides/getting-started', 'guides/manual-setup'],
              },
              {
                label: 'Reference',
                link: '/reference/',
                icon: 'information',
                items: ['reference/api', 'reference/components'],
              },
            ]),
          ],
          title: 'My Docs',
        }),
      ],
    })
    ```
