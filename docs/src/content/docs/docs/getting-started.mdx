description: Learn how to use a dropdown menu to switch between topics in your Starlight website.
---

This package exposes a dropdown menu component meant to be used as a [custom topic list](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/docs/guides/custom-topic-list/) for the [Starlight Sidebar Topics](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/) plugin.

:::tip[See it in action]
At the top of the sidebar, you can find the dropdown menu in action to switch between the different topics used in this documentation, such as "Documentation" and "Demo" that each have their own sidebar configuration, while the "Starlight Docs" topic is a direct link to the Starlight documentation.
:::

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

You will also need to have the [Starlight Sidebar Topics](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/) plugin installed and configured.
If you don't have it set up yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/getting-started) guide in the Starlight Sidebar Topics docs.

## Installation

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { PackageManagers } from "@hideoo/starlight-plugins-docs-components";

<Steps>

1. Starlight Sidebar Topics Dropdown is a Starlight component. Install it using your favorite package manager:

   <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-sidebar-topics-dropdown" />

2. To replace the topic list built-in with the Starlight Sidebar Topics plugin by the dropdown menu provided by this package, configure a [component override](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/#how-to-override) in the `astro.config.mjs` file for the `<Sidebar>` component:

   ```diff lang="js"
   // astro.config.mjs
   // @ts-check
   import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
   import starlightSidebarTopics from 'starlight-sidebar-topics'

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       starlight({
         plugins: [
           starlightSidebarTopics([
             // Your Starlight Sidebar Topics configuration here.
           ]),
         ],
   +      components: {
   +        // Override the default `Sidebar` component with a custom one.
   +        Sidebar: './src/components/Sidebar.astro',
   +      },
         title: 'My Docs',
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

3. Create an Astro component to replace the default Starlight `<Sidebar>` component with which will render the topic list dropdown menu and [re-use the default Starlight sidebar](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/#reuse-a-built-in-component):

   ```astro
   ---
   // src/components/Sidebar.astro
   import Default from '@astrojs/starlight/components/Sidebar.astro';
   import TopicsDropdown from 'starlight-sidebar-topics-dropdown/TopicsDropdown.astro';
   ---

   {/* Render the topics dropdown menu. */}
   <TopicsDropdown />
   {/* Render the default sidebar. */}
   <Default><slot /></Default>
   ```

4. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to preview the changes.

</Steps>

You can also render the dropdown menu in a different location in your website by overriding different components.
